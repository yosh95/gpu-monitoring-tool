```env
# Example configuration for Grafana credentials.
#
# HOW TO USE:
# 1. Copy this file to a new file named .env
#    (e.g., `cp .env.example .env`)
# 2. Edit the .env file with your actual credentials.
#
# The .env file is intentionally not committed to version control (see .gitignore)
# to keep your secrets secure.

# Default Grafana admin username
GRAFANA_ADMIN_USER=admin

# --- IMPORTANT ---
# You MUST change this to a strong and unique password for production environments.
